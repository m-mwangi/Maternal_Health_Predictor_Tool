# Maternal Health Predictor Tool (MaternAI) â€“ Data Documentation

MaternAI is an ML-powered application designed to predict maternal health risks. It classifies patients into different risk levels: High Risk, Mid Risk, and Low Risk. It also contains a web application based on Flask where users can input different values to predict risks.

## Data Sources and Collection Methods  

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle
ðŸ”— [Maternal Health Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csafrit2/maternal-health-risk-data/data)  

## Key Variables
- Age - This is the age in years when a woman is pregnant.
- Systolic Blood Pressure - The upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg.
- Diastolic Blood Pressure - Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg.
- Blood Sugar Levels - Measured in terms of molar concentration, mmol/L.
- Body Temperature - Measured in Fahrenheit.
- Heart Rate - A normal resting heart rate in beats per minute.
- Risk Level - Predicted Risk Intensity Level during pregnancy, considering the previous attributes. Categorized as either 'High Risk', 'Low Risk', or 'Mid Risk'.

## Preprocessing Steps  
To prepare the data for training, the following preprocessing steps were taken:

- Handling Missing Values - Checked for null/missing values and confirmed none existed.  
- Outlier Removal - Applied interquartile range (IQR) technique to identify and remove extreme outliers, particularly in heart rate and body temperature values.  
- Categorical Encoding - The `RiskLevel` categorical feature (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`) was encoded into numerical labels (`0`, `1`, `2`) using Label Encoding.  
- Feature Scaling - Standardization was applied using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to normalize the features.  
- Data Splitting - The cleaned dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance.  

## Visualizations and Data Trends  

To better understand data trends and correlations between features, the following visualizations were created:

1. **Correlation Heatmap**
   - Displays the correlation between various features in the dataset.
   - There is a positive correlation between the input variables and the output variable.
   - The strongest one is in Blood Sugar with 0.58 and the weakest correlation are in Body Temperature and Heart Rate with values of 0.14 and 0.18 respectively.
   - Stystolic BP and Diastolic BP are strongly correlated with value of 0.8. As Systolic BP increases, Diastolic BP also tends to increase.

3. **Boxplot of Blood Pressure by Risk Level**  
   - Shows that higher systolic and diastolic pressures are more commonly associated with medium and high-risk classifications.

4. **Scatter Plot of Heart Rate vs. Age**  
   - Displays a weak correlation but highlights some outliers with elevated heart rates in younger individuals.

5. **Bar Plot of Risk Level Frequency**  
   - Demonstrates that the dataset is fairly balanced across the three risk categories, allowing for effective supervised learning.
